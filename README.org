A emacs package for find replace, written in pure emacs lisp. Purpose similar to unix grep/sed.

This package provides the follow functions:

- xah-find-text                → like grep
- xah-find-text-regex          → like regex grep
- xah-find-count               → like grep count
- xah-find-replace-text        → like sed
- xah-find-replace-text-regex  → like sed

This package is most useful when:

• On Windows and don't have unix find/grep/sed utils installed.

• Process lots Unicode chars. 
See http://xahlee.info/comp/unix_uniq_unicode_bug.html 
and http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_grep_problem.html

• Find/Replace string that contains newline chars.

• You want to use emacs regex, not shell's regex.
