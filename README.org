A emacs package for find replace, written in pure emacs lisp. Purpose similar to unix grep/sed.

This package provides the follow functions:

- xah-find-text
- xah-find-text-regex
- xah-find-count
- xah-find-replace-text
- xah-find-replace-text-regex

Features:

• Pure emacs lisp. No dependencies on unix/linux grep/sed/find. Especially useful on Windows.

• Output is highlighted and clickable for jumping to occurence.

• Reliably Find/Replace string that contains newline chars.

• Reliably Find/Replace string that contains lots Unicode chars. See http://xahlee.info/comp/unix_uniq_unicode_bug.html and http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_grep_problem.html

• Reliably Find/Replace string that contains lots escape slashes or backslashes. For example, regex in source code, Microsoft Windows's path.

• Using emacs regex, not bash/perl etc regex.

These commands treats find/replace string as sequence of chars, not as lines as in grep/sed, so it's much more easier to find or replace a block of text, especially programing language source code.

The printed report is also not based on lines. Instead, visual separator are used for easy reading.

For install, see the file header.
